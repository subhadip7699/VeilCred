# 🔐 Veilcred — Private Access. Verifiable Trust. Zero Identity Exposure.

## Idea Overview

Veilcred is a privacy-preserving credential and access verification protocol built on the Midnight Network Preprod environment.

It allows users to prove they are authorized, allowlisted, or hold a valid credential without revealing their identity or exposing the underlying credential.

The idea is simple:

“Don’t reveal who you are. Prove that you are eligible.”

Veilcred uses Midnight’s Zero-Knowledge capabilities to verify eligibility privately, while also supporting real access requirements such as credential expiration, revocation, multiple issuers, role-based permissions, and protection against credential or proof reuse.

## The Problem

Most access systems reveal more user information than necessary.

To enter a private community, event, partner portal, or restricted application, users may need to expose their identity, wallet, membership record, or credential.

Even basic private allowlists have limitations. Credentials may expire or need to be revoked, different organizations may issue credentials, and the same proof should not be reusable to bypass access rules.

Veilcred solves this by separating identity from eligibility.

The application only needs to verify:

“Does this user currently satisfy the access requirements?”

## 💡 The Solution

Veilcred is a reusable Zero-Knowledge Access Gateway.

Trusted issuers can issue credentials with specific roles and validity periods. A user privately proves that they hold a valid credential that satisfies the gate’s rules without exposing the credential itself.

Private Credential → ZK Proof → Policy Verification → Access Granted

Each gate can verify conditions such as:

* Is the credential valid and not expired?
* Has the credential been revoked?
* Was it issued by an approved issuer?
* Does the user have the required role?
* Is access allowed during this time period?
* Has this credential or proof already been used where reuse is restricted?

Only when the required conditions are satisfied is access granted.

## How Veilcred Works

1. Create Gate — An operator creates a protected gate and defines its access rules.

2. Issue Credential — One or more trusted issuers can issue eligible users private credentials with roles and expiration conditions.

3. Connect Wallet — The user connects a Midnight-compatible wallet on Preprod.

4. Generate ZK Proof — The user proves they hold a valid credential that satisfies the gate’s requirements without revealing the raw credential.

5. Verify Access — The Compact contract verifies validity, issuer, expiration, revocation, role/time rules, and reuse protection where required.

6. Unlock — Successful verification grants access to the protected resource.

## Privacy Model

Veilcred follows one principle:

“Reveal the result, not the secret.”

The system verifies only what is required for access while keeping the user’s raw credential, private credential data, and unnecessary identity information hidden.

Nullifier-based or equivalent reuse protection prevents the same proof or credential from being improperly reused where one-time verification is required.

This allows Veilcred to prove:

“Valid credential + correct permission + currently eligible”

without unnecessarily revealing:

“Who exactly is this user?”

## SDK/API for Developers

Veilcred is designed as reusable infrastructure, not just a single dApp.

A lightweight Veilcred SDK/API will allow Midnight developers to integrate private access verification into their own applications.

Developers will be able to define a gate, configure trusted issuers and access policies, request credential proofs, verify access, and receive a simple authorization result.

This makes Veilcred useful as a privacy layer that other Midnight applications can build on instead of implementing their own credential verification system from scratch.

## Real Sample dApp

To demonstrate the complete integration, Veilcred will include a sample Midnight dApp with a protected private resource.

For example, a private event portal where only users with a valid, non-expired “VIP” credential from an approved issuer can unlock VIP content.

The complete flow demonstrates:

Credential Issuer → Private Credential → Veilcred SDK → ZK Verification → Compact Contract → Protected Feature Unlocked

If a credential is expired, revoked, issued by an untrusted issuer, has the wrong role, or violates reuse rules, access is denied.

This demonstrates Veilcred protecting a real application feature rather than only showing a standalone proof demo.

## Why Midnight?

Privacy is the foundation of Veilcred.

Midnight allows Veilcred to combine private inputs, Zero-Knowledge proofs, programmable access policies, and verifiable blockchain execution.

Private Credential → ZK Verification → Minimum Disclosure → Trusted Access

This allows applications to verify eligibility without making sensitive credential information publicly visible.

## Preprod Implementation

Veilcred will run on Midnight Preprod with an end-to-end flow:

Connect Wallet → Load Gate → Provide Private Credential → Generate ZK Proof → Verify Credential + Access Policy → Prevent Invalid/Reuse Attempts → Unlock Protected Resource

The sample dApp will use the Veilcred SDK/API and deployed Compact contract to demonstrate this complete flow on Preprod.

## 🚀 Vision

Veilcred aims to become a reusable privacy and access infrastructure layer for Midnight applications.

Developers should be able to define rules such as:

“Prove you are a valid member.”

“Prove your credential has not expired or been revoked.”

“Prove you have the required role.”

“Prove you are eligible without revealing who you are.”

Veilcred turns those requirements into privacy-preserving, programmable access rules that can be integrated into real applications.

Verify what matters. Keep everything else private.

Veilcred — Verifiable by design. Private by default.
